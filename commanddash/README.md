# CommandDash

CLI enhancments to Dash-AI. Coming Soon âœ¨

Notes:
- CLI should be completely stateless. It doesn't store or have direct access to any user data. It fully relies on the clients to provide any kind of user data. - tokens, cache, booleans.
- It does, however, have access to the project in the same system as the CLI and can access it files for processing purposes. It can also access Flutter/Dart related tooling.
